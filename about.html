     <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
        Founded in 1897, the Animal Lifeline-Durban & Coast along with the SPCA is one of South Africa's oldest and most respected animal welfare organisations. Animal Lifeline is a separate entity but works closely with the SPCA to ensure that all animals in need receive the best possible care and attention.
        As a registered non-profit (NPO 002-312) and a Public Benefit Organisation (PBO 930001302), we have dedicated over a century to 
        rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming animals in KwaZulu-Natal. Our mission is to prevent cruelty to animals, rescue those in need, and provide them with shelter, medical care, and love. 
        We aim to educate the public about responsible pet ownership, promote animal welfare, and ensure that every animal has the chance 
        to live in a safe and loving environment.
      </p>

        <h2>MEET THE TEAM!!</h2>
        <p>The daily operations of the organisation are managed by a skilled and committed team of veterinarians, inspectors, kennel personnel, and administrative staff, led by General Manager Caroline Smith.
            Together, they ensure that every animal receives the medical attention, care, and attention it needs.

    <h2>Our History:</h2> <img src="_images/oldpic.jpg" alt="History" width="350" height="300">
      <p>
        The Animal Lifeline movement began in England in 1824, and in South Africa, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA was founded in 1872 then Animal Lifeline.
        The Animal Lifeline-Durban & Coast and SPCA has been operational since 1897, growing from a small group of passionate animal lovers into 
        a large organisation that handles thousands of cases of animal cruelty, neglect, and abandonment every year. 
        We have remained a trusted community resource for over 125 years.Far more than just an animal shelter and adoption facility, 
        the Animal Lifeline plays a humanising role in society, educating people, especially children about the rights of all living creatures, and working for better legal protection for animals (particularly farm animals) and more severe penalties for perpetrators of cruelty.
