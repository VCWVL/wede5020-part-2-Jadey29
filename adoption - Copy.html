    <h3>Why Adopt?</h3>
    <p>
      Thousands of animals are abandoned every year. By adopting, you help reduce 
      overpopulation and give a deserving animal a second chance at life. Our adoption 
      fees cover sterilization, vaccinations, and a vet check-up, giving you peace of 
      mind and saving you costs in the long run.

    <p> Choosing to adopt a pet is one of the most rewarding decisions you can make. 
      By adopting, you are giving an abandoned or abused animal a chance at a new, 
      loving home. Every adoption helps us continue our mission of preventing cruelty 
      and promoting kindness to animals.</p>
