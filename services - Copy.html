    <p>
      The Durban & Coast SPCA is committed to promoting animal welfare and preventing cruelty. 
      We provide a wide range of services to ensure that animals in Durban and surrounding areas are cared for, protected, and given a chance at a happy life. 
      Our dedicated team works tirelessly to educate, rescue, and support both animals and pet owners.
    </p>

    
      <h3>Vet Clinic & Microchipping</h3>
      <p>
        Our veterinary clinic provides essential medical care for pets of all ages. Services include routine health checks, vaccinations, sterilizations, and treatment for illnesses or injuries. 
        Microchipping is also available to help reunite lost pets with their owners. 
        We prioritize underprivileged families and pensioners, offering affordable treatment without compromising quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our fully equipped clinic has an operating theatre for surgeries and sterilizations. Each animal is carefully assessed, and follow-up treatment is provided if necessary. 
        By ensuring pets are healthy and microchipped, we help reduce stray populations and promote responsible pet ownership.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Animal Shelter</h3>
      <p>
        The SPCA provides a safe and nurturing environment for stray, abandoned, or surrendered animals. Dogs and cats receive food, medical care, socialization, and attention from our dedicated staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Animals stay at the shelter until they are reclaimed by owners or adopted into new homes. 
        This gives them a second chance at life and helps relieve overcrowding in the community. 
        We actively work to find loving families and provide support to ensure a smooth transition into their new homes.
      </p>

      <h3>Humane Education & Pet Care Tips</h3>
      <p>
        Education is one of the most powerful tools in preventing cruelty. Our programs teach children and adults how to care for animals responsibly. 
        Topics include nutrition, housing, health care, and enrichment for pets, as well as respect for wildlife.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through school visits, workshops, and community talks, we reach hundreds of learners each year. 
        Participants learn how to recognize neglect and abuse, report concerns, and develop compassion for all living beings. 
        By fostering empathy and responsibility, we aim to create a safer environment for animals in our community.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Resources for Pet Owners</h3>
      <p>
        Our resources service provides guidance and support to pet owners. We offer advice on nutrition, training, vaccination schedules, and preventive care. 
        Pet owners can also access information about local services, such as boarding kennels, groomers, and emergency veterinary care.
      </p>
      <p>
        We regularly distribute informative leaflets and hold Q&A sessions to address common concerns. 
        By equipping owners with knowledge, we help improve the quality of life for pets and prevent issues that could lead to neglect or abandonment.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Boarding Kennels</h3>
      <p>
        Our boarding facilities offer temporary care for dogs while their owners are away. Animals enjoy safe, comfortable housing, regular walks, and exercise in our yards. 
        Our staff provides attentive care to ensure pets feel secure and happy during their stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vaccination proof is required for all animals. Puppies under 10 months cannot be accommodated, and we follow strict health protocols to protect all residents. 
        Boarding fees are affordable, and bookings can be made in advance to ensure availability.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Lost & Found</h3>
      <p>
        The Lost & Found service helps reunite lost pets with their owners. Found animals are cared for at the SPCA while efforts are made to locate the rightful owners. 
        Microchipped and sterilized pets have a higher chance of being returned quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pet owners are encouraged to visit the SPCA if their pet goes missing. We also advise searching the neighbourhood, posting notices, and calling the SPCA for assistance. 
        Our team maintains a registry of all found pets and ensures they are safely looked after during the search process.
      </p>
    

      <h3>Inspector on Call</h3>
      <p>
        Our inspectors are available 24/7 to respond to reports of cruelty, neglect, or injury. They handle cases involving domestic pets, farm animals, and wildlife. 
        Inspectors investigate complaints, enforce animal protection laws, and take appropriate action to ensure animals are safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspectors also assist owners whose pets are trapped, monitor animal facilities, and provide guidance on proper care. 
        Their work ensures that animal welfare standards are maintained across the community and that offenders are held accountable.
      </p>
    

      <h3>Animal Care Centre</h3>
      <p>
        Our modern care centre provides shelter for stray, abandoned, or surrendered animals. Pets receive medical care, socialization, and comfort while waiting to be reclaimed or adopted. 
        This ensures they are safe and well-cared for during a stressful time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adoption programs at the centre help match animals with suitable families. We provide guidance to adopters to ensure pets transition smoothly into their new homes, increasing the likelihood of long-term success.
